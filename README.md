<br>
The idea to download video from facebook private group is just extract video link from source code.
<br>
<p><b>Step 1 :</b> append "view-source:" before link</p>
<p><b>Step 2 :</b> search "playable_url_quality_hd" and copy the 10 to 20 lines that contains search matched to filter with regex</p>
<p><b>Step 3 :</b> Regex <a href="https://regexr.com/5gdfd">step 1</a>: search match = ("playable_url_quality_hd"):"([^"]*) and replace = $2<p>
<p><b>Step 4 :</b> Regex <a href="https://regexr.com/5fd7j">step 2</a>: copy output from step 1 and do search match = u0025 and replace = %<p>
<p> You will get output link</p>
